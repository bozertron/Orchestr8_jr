Once scouts complete their reconnaissance and file their reports in /home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/Agent Deployment Strategy/SCOUT_REPORTS/, this synthesizer will consolidate findings to determine: (1) Overall UI compliance status with stereOS v3.0 spec, (2) Critical gaps blocking release, (3) Deferrable gaps for future sprints, (4) Marimo framework limitations affecting stereOS compliance, and (5) Recommended UI tasks for immediate action. Current status: WAITING_FOR_SCOUTS.",
