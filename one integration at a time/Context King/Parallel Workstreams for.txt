Parallel Workstreams for You

Here's what needs work that I won't be touching while implementing Woven Maps in The Void:
1. Connection Verifier / Import Resolution (CRITICAL)

Current state: orchestr8.py:verify_connections() extracts imports via regex but doesn't verify they resolve.

What's needed:

    Actually check if import foo → does foo.py exist?
    Resolve relative imports (from . import bar)
    Handle package imports (from package.submodule import thing)
    Return broken imports as errors (feeds into Blue status)

Files: orchestr8.py lines 104-144, potentially new IP/connection_verifier.py
2. Health Checker Expansion (HIGH)

Current state: IP/health_checker.py only runs npm run typecheck

What's needed:

    Python support: mypy, ruff check, python -m py_compile
    Fallback when no package.json exists
    Parse actual error messages (line numbers, error codes)
    Integration with LSP if available

File: IP/health_checker.py
3. Combat State Management (MEDIUM)

Current state: FiefdomStatus.COMBAT exists but nothing sets it

What's needed:

    Track which files have an LLM General deployed
    Mechanism to mark/unmark combat status
    Maybe a JSON file: .orchestr8/combat_state.json
    Hook into terminal spawner to auto-set combat on deploy

Files: New IP/combat_tracker.py or extend IP/mermaid_generator.py
4. Edge Data → Woven Maps Bridge (MEDIUM)

Current state:

    orchestr8.py produces edges_df (actual import connections)
    woven_maps.py uses Delaunay triangulation (geometric, not semantic)

What's needed:

    Feed actual import edges into Woven Maps visualization
    Draw import connections as distinct lines (different opacity/color)
    Highlight broken imports (Blue dotted lines?)

Files: IP/woven_maps.py (I'll leave hooks for you), orchestr8.py
5. Briefing Generator Content (LOW - but important for LLM deploys)

Current state: IP/briefing_generator.py exists (180 lines)

What's needed:

    Review if it generates BRIEFING.md correctly
    Include file context, recent changes, error details
    Format optimized for Claude Code consumption

File: IP/briefing_generator.py
Summary Table
Priority	Module	What To Do
🔴 CRITICAL	Connection Verifier	Verify imports actually resolve
🟠 HIGH	Health Checker	Python support (mypy/ruff)
🟡 MEDIUM	Combat Tracker	Track LLM deployments
🟡 MEDIUM	Edge Bridge	Feed real imports to Woven Maps
🟢 LOW	Briefing Generator	Review/enhance content

I'll focus on: Integrating woven_maps.py into 06_maestro.py so The Void renders the Code City.

You can focus on: Connection verification (#1) and health checker expansion (#2) - these are the data feeders that make the city accurate.

Sound good?
