## Current Program Posture

1. Wave-3 delivered core packet outputs and produced strategy proposals for C2P + Phreak/CSE.
2. Founder directive prefers one-shot long-run execution and reduced mayor interruption cost.
3. Wave-4 should prioritize immediate MVP leverage (2-hour visible gains) with strict evidence gates.

## Lane Readiness Snapshot

- orchestr8_jr: P07-A7 - Run Wave-4 governance loop with auto-forward unlock prep and batch replay decisions.
- a_codex_plan: P07-B7 - Ship Phreak/CSE foundation with settings-driven behavior and stable integration tests.
- 2ndFid_explorers: P07-C7 - Deliver extraction pair for intent parsing and settings validation patterns.
- or8_founder_console: P07-FC-06 - Ship C2P Wave-4 MVP: observation sync + review queue for launch-ready packets.
- mingos_settlement_lab: P07-MSL-06 - Publish implementable Phreak visual transfer packet and CSE UI constraints matrix.

## Risks and Ambiguities

| Item | Risk/Ambiguity | Initial fact check |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Can we run auto-forward with larger roadmap slices? | Yes. Prefer one-shot long-run execution with minimal back-and-forth. |
| 2 | What planning shape is preferred? | Large roadmap with clear rails to high-quality MVP for friendly-circle testing. |
| 3 | Should likely 2-hour gains be prioritized into active packets immediately? | Yes. If likely benefit in two hours, include now with advanced operator-grade directions. |

## Inputs Required From Founder

1. No open founder questions in this planning cycle.
