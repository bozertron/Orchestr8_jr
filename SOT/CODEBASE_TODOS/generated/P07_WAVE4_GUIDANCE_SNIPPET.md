- Context: Wave-4 unlock prep from one shared collaboration spec.
- Guidance:
  - Unlocked packets: P07-B7, P07-C7, P07-FC-06, P07-MSL-06
  - Required read order: README.AGENTS -> HARD_REQUIREMENTS.md -> LONG_RUN_MODE.md -> boundary -> resume -> lane TODO
  - Long-run mode enforced: low interruption, one end-of-window bundle, no assumptions
  - Ambiguity rule enforced: local probe + cross-codebase probe, then defer and continue
  - Founder questions still open: none
  - Unlock observation IDs: unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown

  - Intake one long-run evidence bundle per lane and replay before acceptance.
