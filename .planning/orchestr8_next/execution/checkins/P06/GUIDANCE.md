- Date: 2026-02-14 12:30:52
- Author: Codex
- Context: Cross-agent sync requested by founder
- Guidance: Other agent please post STATUS/BLOCKERS acknowledgment for active packet and confirm current blockers + next three actions.
- Impacted Files: .planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/STATUS.md, .planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/BLOCKERS.md
- Required Follow-up: Reply in STATUS.md with timestamped ack and gate color.

- Date: 2026-02-14 13:21:00
- Author: Codex
- Context: Founder requested robust cross-agent connectivity path.
- Guidance:
  - Adopt OR8-COMMS v1 over shared memory gateway immediately.
  - Use `scripts/agent_comms.sh` for send/ack/inbox/thread operations.
  - Follow handshake flow documented in:
    - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/AGENT_COMMS_PROTOCOL.md`
- Impacted Files:
  - `scripts/agent_comms.sh`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/AGENT_COMMS_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/STATUS.md`
- Required Follow-up:
  - Post one live handshake proof in active `STATUS.md`:
    - sent message id
    - ack message id
    - cid thread output summary

- Date: 2026-02-15 10:58:07
- Author: Codex
- Context: P05 completed and founder cleared startup of P06.
- Guidance:
  - Start `P06-WP01` only (regression + reliability harness).
  - Execute under:
    - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/AUTONOMY_BOUNDARY_WP01.md`
  - Focus lanes:
    - startup reliability checks
    - lower-fifth/core control regression checks
    - adapter-failure isolation validation
  - Produce first P06 reliability artifact in:
    - `.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P06/`
- Impacted Files:
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/AUTONOMY_BOUNDARY_WP01.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/STATUS.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/BLOCKERS.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P06/*`
- Required Follow-up:
  - Post WP01 kickoff acknowledgment in `P06/STATUS.md`.
  - Include exact regression/reliability command set and pass/fail totals in next update.

- Date: 2026-02-15 11:06:07
- Author: Codex
- Context: P06-WP01 artifacts transferred to canonical repo and verified.
- Guidance:
  - `P06-WP01` accepted in canonical repo after verification:
    - `python3 -m py_compile orchestr8_next/shell/actions.py orchestr8_next/shell/contracts.py orchestr8_next/shell/reducer.py orchestr8_next/shell/store.py orchestr8_next/city/contracts.py orchestr8_next/city/bridge.py tests/reliability/test_reliability.py` => pass
    - `pytest tests/reliability/test_reliability.py -vv` => 3 passed
  - Boundary is now unlocked to `P06-WP02` only.
  - Execute WP02 under:
    - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/AUTONOMY_BOUNDARY_WP02.md`
  - Use `OR8_PHASE=P06` when sending progress pings.
- Impacted Files:
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/AUTONOMY_BOUNDARY_WP02.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/STATUS.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/BLOCKERS.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P06/*`
- Required Follow-up:
  - Post WP02 kickoff acknowledgment in `P06/STATUS.md`.
  - Include exact cutover/rollback rehearsal command set and report paths in next update.

- Date: 2026-02-15 11:13:35
- Author: Codex
- Context: P06-WP02 artifacts transferred to canonical repo and verified.
- Guidance:
  - `P06-WP02` accepted in canonical repo after verification:
    - `ORCHESTR8_RENDER_MODE=WIDGET pytest tests/city/test_parity.py -vv` => 3 passed
    - `ORCHESTR8_RENDER_MODE=IFRAME pytest tests/city/test_parity.py -vv` => 3 passed
    - `bash scripts/verify_rehearsal.sh` => pass
  - Boundary is now unlocked to `P06-WP03` only.
  - Execute WP03 under:
    - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/AUTONOMY_BOUNDARY_WP03.md`
  - Use `OR8_PHASE=P06` when sending progress pings.
- Impacted Files:
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/AUTONOMY_BOUNDARY_WP03.md`
  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/checkins/P06/STATUS.md`

  - `.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P06/*`
- Required Follow-up:
  - Post WP03 kickoff acknowledgment in `P06/STATUS.md`.
