# Autonomy Boundary: P07-MSL-05 (mingos_settlement_lab)

## Objective

Produce production-grade UI-constraint transfer artifacts from approved static dashboard references and latest Wave-2 integration outputs.

## Allowed Work

- Create implementable UI constraints packet and integration handoff.
- Cross-link constraints to active packet outputs and test hooks.
- Deliver canonical report with traceability.

## Must Not Do

- Implement runtime code in Orchestr8_jr.
- Omit provenance links.

## Required Evidence

- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/transfer/MSL_05_UI_CONSTRAINTS_PACKET.md`
- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/transfer/MSL_05_INTEGRATION_HANDOFF.md`
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/MSL-05_REPORT.md`

## Required Validation

- Report includes traceability table from static UI references and MSL hooks to each constraint/handoff rule.
