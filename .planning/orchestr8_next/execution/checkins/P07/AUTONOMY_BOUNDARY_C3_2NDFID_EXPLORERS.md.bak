# Autonomy Boundary: P07-C3 (2ndFid_explorers)

## Objective

Deliver the next extraction/conversion packet pair focused on orchestration UX and execution observability patterns that strengthen Orchestr8 + Code City.

## Allowed Work

- Perform line-by-line 2ndFid analysis for two high-value components.
- Produce clean-room extraction packets with provenance and contract targets.
- Flag licensing concerns and request orchestr8-native redesign guidance when needed.
- Deliver canonical packet artifacts with proof.

## Must Not Do

- Copy or port licensed implementation code directly into Orchestr8 outputs.
- Skip canonical artifact delivery proof.
- Advance to implementation lane decisions (belongs to codex + a_codex_plan).

## Required Evidence

- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C3_01_<Name>.md`
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C3_02_<Name>.md`
- For each packet: provenance path, value statement, clean-room conversion plan, target contracts, risk class, licensing flag.
- Canonical delivery proof (`cp` + `ls -l`).

## Licensing Escalation Rule

If any licensing concern appears:

1. Stop direct-lift proposal for that item.
2. Send `LICENSING_ESCALATION` note to codex.
3. Send redesign request to `a_codex_plan` for orchestr8-native alternative.
4. Wait for ack/guidance before continuing that packet.
