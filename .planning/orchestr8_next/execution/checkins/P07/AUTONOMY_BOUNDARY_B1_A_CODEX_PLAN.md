# Autonomy Boundary: P07-B1 (a_codex_plan)

## Objective

Integrate approved packets into marimo-first core runtime with reliable contracts and tests.

## Allowed Work

- Core integration work in adapters/middleware/routing/contracts.
- Integrate only C1 packets that have canonical approval.
- Produce smoke/regression evidence and status updates.

## Must Not Do

- Make final visual placement decisions.
- Modify canonical UI files in `IP/*` unless explicitly unlocked.
- Start packaging/compliance phase before explicit core acceptance.

## Required Evidence

- `B1_INTEGRATION_SMOKE_REPORT.md`
- Exact test commands + pass counts.
- Status updates in `checkins/P07/STATUS.md`.
- Canonical destination delivery proof:
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/B1_INTEGRATION_SMOKE_REPORT.md`
