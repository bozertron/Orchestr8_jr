# Autonomy Boundary: P07-B2 (a_codex_plan)

## Objective

Continue marimo-first core integration with enhanced reliability and contract hardening.

## Allowed Work

- Core integration work in adapters/middleware/routing/contracts.
- Integrate approved C2 extraction packets after canonical approval.
- Produce smoke/regression evidence with canonical delivery.
- Enhance test coverage for integrated components.

## Must Not Do

- Make final visual placement decisions (canonical lane authority).
- Modify canonical UI files in `IP/*` without explicit freeze unlock.
- Start packaging/compliance phase before explicit core acceptance.
- Deliver reports to non-canonical paths (use ARTIFACT_DELIVERY_CONTRACT.md).

## Required Evidence

- `orchestr8_next/city/topology.py` delivered/updated in canonical repo.
- `orchestr8_next/city/heatmap.py` delivered/updated in canonical repo.
- `tests/integration/test_graphs.py` delivered/updated in canonical repo.
- `B2_INTEGRATION_SMOKE_REPORT.md` delivered to canonical path.
- Exact test commands + pass counts.
- Status updates via comms to codex.
- Canonical destination delivery proof:
  - `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/B2_INTEGRATION_SMOKE_REPORT.md`

## Unlock Authority
