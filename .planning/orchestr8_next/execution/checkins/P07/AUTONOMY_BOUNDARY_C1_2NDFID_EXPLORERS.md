# Autonomy Boundary: P07-C1 (2ndFid_explorers)

## Objective

Produce line-by-line extraction/conversion packets from 2ndFid for orchestr8+Code City value.

## Allowed Work

- Analyze 2ndFid source files and identify high-value patterns.
- Propose clean-room conversion plans.
- Submit extraction packets to canonical lane for approval.
- Escalate licensing concerns via required comms flow.

## Must Not Do

- Directly copy/port licensed code into Orchestr8 outputs.
- Bypass canonical approval before downstream integration.

## Required Evidence

- Extraction packet docs with provenance and conversion plan.
- Licensing concern flags and decisions.
- Status updates in `checkins/P07/STATUS.md`.
- Canonical destination delivery proof for extraction packet files under:
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/`
