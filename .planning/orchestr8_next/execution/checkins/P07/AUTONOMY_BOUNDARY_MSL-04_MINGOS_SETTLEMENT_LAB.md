# Autonomy Boundary: P07-MSL-04 (mingos_settlement_lab)

## Objective

Produce executable test-hook and acceptance matrix package for the settlement modules to accelerate implementation/replay in core integration lanes.

## Allowed Work

- Derive concrete test hooks from settlement specs/backlog.
- Build acceptance matrix mapping modules -> tests -> evidence expectations.
- Deliver canonical report with traceability.

## Must Not Do

- Implement runtime code in Orchestr8_jr.
- Omit provenance links.

## Required Evidence

- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/transfer/MSL_04_TEST_HOOKS.md`
- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/transfer/MSL_04_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md`
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/MSL-04_REPORT.md`

## Required Validation

- Report includes traceability table from MSL module specs to each proposed test hook.

## Unlock Authority
