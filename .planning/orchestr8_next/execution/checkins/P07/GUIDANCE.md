- Context: Founder-directed auto-forward mode enabled; Wave-4 launched from one-shot long-run package.
- Guidance:
  - Wave-4 packet set unlocked and activated in parallel:
    - `P07-A7` canonical governance loop
    - `P07-B7` for `a_codex_plan`
    - `P07-C7` for `2ndFid_explorers`

    - `scripts/generated/P07_wave4_unlock_broadcast.sh`
    - `scripts/generated/P07_wave4_canonical_kickoff.sh`
  - Shared-memory unlock guidance delivered:
    - `a_codex_plan` `#1673`
    - `2ndFid_explorers` `#1674`
    - `or8_founder_console` `#1675`
    - `mingos_settlement_lab` `#1676`

  - Canonical kickoff evidence:
    - A7 checkout received `#1678`
    - checkout ACK sent `#1679`
    - wave launch summary persisted `#1680`
  - Comms reliability note:
    - initial writes were spooled; replayed to shared memory via `scripts/agent_comms.sh flush` (`sent=6 failed=0`)
  - Operational mode remains: long-run execution, no assumptions, two hard-fact probes then defer-and-continue.

- Required Follow-up:
  - Collect remaining Wave-4 lane checkout ACKs and keep windows unblocked.
  - Intake one end-of-window evidence bundle per lane and run replay decisions in batch.
  - Prepare Wave-5 unlock set before Wave-4 closeout to maintain continuous lane motion.
