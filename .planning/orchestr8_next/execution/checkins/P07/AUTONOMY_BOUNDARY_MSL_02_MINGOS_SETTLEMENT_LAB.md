# Autonomy Boundary: P07-MSL-02 (mingos_settlement_lab)

## Objective

Convert the MSL-01 synthesis baseline into implementation-grade module specifications and transfer packets usable by `a_codex_plan`.

## Allowed Work

- Expand topic synthesis into concrete module specifications.
- Create transfer packets with interface contracts, dependencies, and acceptance checks.
- Update settlement PRD outline with traceability links.
- Deliver canonical report artifact with proof.

## Must Not Do

- Implement production runtime code in Orchestr8_jr.
- Skip provenance links from module spec claims to corpus/synthesis sources.
- Change packet governance rules.

## Required Evidence

- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/specs/MSL_02_MODULE_01_CITY_LIFE.md`
- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/specs/MSL_02_MODULE_02_POWER_GRID.md`
- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/specs/MSL_02_MODULE_03_TEMPORAL_STATE.md`
- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/transfer/MSL_02_TRANSFER_PACKET.md`
- `/home/bozertron/mingos_settlement_lab/transfer/SETTLEMENT_PRD_OUTLINE.md` (updated)
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/MSL-02_REPORT.md` with delivery proof.

## Required Validation

- File existence/listing proof for all required spec/transfer files.
- Traceability section in report mapping each module spec to source docs.

## Unlock Authority

- Unlocked by: Codex (P07 orchestration)
- Effective: 2026-02-16
