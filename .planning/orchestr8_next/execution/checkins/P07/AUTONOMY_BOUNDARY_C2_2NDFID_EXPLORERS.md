# Autonomy Boundary: P07-C2 (2ndFid_explorers)

## Objective

Continue extraction/conversion packet production with enhanced provenance tracking.

## Allowed Work

- Analyze 2ndFid source files and identify high-value patterns.
- Propose clean-room conversion plans with detailed provenance.
- Submit extraction packets to canonical lane for approval.
- Escalate licensing concerns via required comms flow.
- Build on C1 extraction foundation with expanded scope.

## Must Not Do

- Directly copy/port licensed code into Orchestr8 outputs.
- Bypass canonical approval before downstream integration.
- Deliver extraction packets to non-canonical paths.

## Required Evidence

- Extraction packet docs with provenance and conversion plan.
- Licensing concern flags and decisions.
- Status updates via comms to codex.
- Canonical destination delivery proof:
  - `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C2_01_*.md`
  - `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C2_02_*.md`
