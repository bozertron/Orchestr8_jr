# Autonomy Boundary: P07-C5 (2ndFid_explorers)

## Objective

Deliver next extraction pair focused on timeline/inspection patterns that improve Code City observability and operator clarity.

## Allowed Work

- Line-by-line source analysis for two high-value components.
- Produce clean-room extraction packets with provenance and target contracts.
- Escalate licensing concerns per protocol.

## Must Not Do

- Direct code lift into Orchestr8 outputs.
- Skip canonical delivery proof.

## Required Evidence

- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C5_01_*.md`
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C5_02_*.md`

Each packet must include:
- source provenance path
- concept summary
- orchestr8/code-city value
- clean-room plan
- target contracts
- risk class + licensing flag
