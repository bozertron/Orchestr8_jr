# Autonomy Boundary: P07-C4 (2ndFid_explorers)

## Objective

Deliver the next extraction packet pair for command orchestration and layer management patterns that can strengthen Orchestr8's multi-agent control surfaces.

## Allowed Work

- Analyze 2ndFid source components line-by-line for high-value orchestration patterns.
- Produce clean-room extraction packets with provenance, contracts, and risk notes.
- Escalate licensing concerns immediately via protocol.
- Deliver canonical artifacts with explicit copy/list proof.

## Must Not Do

- Copy or port licensed implementation code into Orchestr8 outputs.
- Skip canonical delivery proof.
- Make implementation decisions for integration lane.

## Required Evidence

- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C4_01_*.md`
- `/home/bozertron/Orchestr8_jr/.planning/orchestr8_next/artifacts/P07/P07_C4_02_*.md`
- Packet contents must include: source path/provenance, concept summary, orchestr8/code-city value, clean-room plan, target contracts, risk class, licensing flag.

## Licensing Escalation Rule

If any licensing concern appears:
1. Stop direct-lift proposal for that item.
2. Send `LICENSING_ESCALATION` to codex.
3. Send redesign request to `a_codex_plan` for orchestr8-native implementation strategy.
4. Wait for ack/guidance before continuing the affected packet.
