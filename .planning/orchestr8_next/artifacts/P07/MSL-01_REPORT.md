# MSL-01 Report: Corpus Intake & Synthesis

## Summary

Successfully executed MSL-01 packet objectives:

1. **Corpus Index:** Created `corpus/CORPUS_INDEX.md` cataloging 7 initial project documents.
2. **Topic Syntheses:** Generated 5 synthesis documents in `synthesis/` covering Vision, Architecture, Governance, Context, and Transfer.
3. **PRD Outline:** Drafted `transfer/SETTLEMENT_PRD_OUTLINE.md` based on `PRD.md` and synthesized insights.

## Artifacts Created
