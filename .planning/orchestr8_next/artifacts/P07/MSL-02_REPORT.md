# MSL-02 Report: Module Specifications & Transfer

## Summary

Successfully executed MSL-02 packet objectives:

1. **Module Specifications:** Created detailed specs for City Life, Power Grid, and Temporal State modules.
2. **Transfer Packet:** Generated `transfer/MSL_02_TRANSFER_PACKET.md` defining implementation contracts for `a_codex_plan`.
3. **PRD Outline:** Updated `transfer/SETTLEMENT_PRD_OUTLINE.md` with new module details.

## Artifacts Created

### Specifications

- `specs/MSL_02_MODULE_01_CITY_LIFE.md`
- `specs/MSL_02_MODULE_02_POWER_GRID.md`
- `specs/MSL_02_MODULE_03_TEMPORAL_STATE.md`

### Transfer

- `transfer/MSL_02_TRANSFER_PACKET.md`
- `transfer/SETTLEMENT_PRD_OUTLINE.md` (Updated)

## Traceability Matrix

| Module Spec | Source Document | Key Concept |
|---|---|---|
| MSL-MOD-01 (City Life) | MSL-DOC-001 (PRD) | Agents as Citizens, Workspaces as Dwellings |
| MSL-MOD-01 (City Life) | MSL-DOC-004 (Story) | Visualization of agent activity |
| MSL-MOD-02 (Power Grid) | MSL-DOC-002 (Arch) | Flow of guidance and authority |
| MSL-MOD-02 (Power Grid) | MSL-DOC-005 (Guidance) | Blocking issues as load/outages |
| MSL-MOD-03 (Temporal State) | MSL-DOC-004 (Reqs) | Hard strictures on history/artifacts |
| MSL-MOD-03 (Temporal State) | MSL-DOC-005 (Guidance) | Phases and Checkpoints (Epochs) |

## Verification

- All specs follow the standard template.
- Transfer packet defines clear inputs/outputs/acceptance criteria.
- PRD outline reflects the newly defined modules.
