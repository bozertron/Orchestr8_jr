# Roadmap: What Orchestr8 Becomes

## Product North Star

Orchestr8 becomes a deterministic visual software manipulation and invention cockpit: reliable at core, high-bandwidth for multi-agent work, and centered on Code City as the living operational map.

## Strategic Identity

- Orchestr8 is a standalone development environment for codebase orchestration and invention.
- It is not a generic IDE clone.
- It is not dependent on one AI vendor or one editor.
- It is the place where architecture, implementation, and operational signals converge visually.

## Value Pillars

1. Deterministic Control Plane
- Every control works predictably.
- Every state transition is traceable.

2. Visual Operations Plane
- Code City remains a first-class spatial map.
- Wiring, health, and agent activity are visible and actionable.

3. Multi-Agent Throughput
- External and internal agents can contribute in parallel through defined packets.
- Orchestr8 remains the governor of quality gates.

4. Capability Convergence
- Consolidate Orchestr8 capabilities behind stable contracts.
- Reduce fragility by promoting one validated slice at a time.

## Program Timeline

### Horizon 0: Stabilize Basics (P00-P02)
- Finalize architecture contracts.
- Ship working lower fifth with full 12-control behavior.
- Stand up adapter-driven services and comms.

### Horizon 1: Integrate Workflows (P03-P04)
- Connect optional IDE/workspace adapters.
- Reconnect Code City through clean contracts.
- Restore practical day-to-day reliability.

### Horizon 2: Capability Deepening (P05)
- Integrate higher-value capability slices one domain at a time.
- Confirm contract stability across core shell, adapters, and visualization.

### Horizon 3: Hardening + Cutover (P06)
- Reliability gates, test gates, performance gates.
- Promote orchestr8_next to canonical path.

## Milestone Outcomes

M1: "Buttons Never Lie"
- Lower fifth complete and deterministic.

M2: "Adapters Over Entanglement"
- IO and integrations are swappable modules.

M3: "City Reborn"
- Code City fully operational under clean boundary contracts.

M4: "Capabilities in the Loop"
- High-value capability slices validated and promoted in Orchestr8.

M5: "Production Discipline"
- Repeatable cutover process and stable daily operation.

## KPI Frame

- Control Reliability: 99% successful action dispatch/response.
- Startup Determinism: no external AI dependency during boot.
- Mean Time to Diagnose UI issue: < 10 minutes via event traces.
- Code City Reconnect Latency: < 2 seconds on mode switch.
- Adapter Failure Isolation: core remains functional when any adapter is down.
- Capability Slice Promotion Rate: at least 1 promoted Orchestr8 slice per cycle after P05 starts.

## Roadmap Risks

- Overloading P01 with too many non-core features.
- Re-coupling adapters directly to UI components.
- Bringing full legacy modules at once instead of vertical slices.
- Allowing provider-specific logic into core runtime.

## Governance Rules

1. No phase promotion without gate evidence.
2. No direct service calls from UI components.
3. No contract changes without version bump.
4. No feature merges without check-in artifacts.

## End State Definition

At roadmap completion, Orchestr8 is:
- Fast to launch,
- reliable for daily use,
- rich in visual operations,
- and fully focused on Orchestr8-native value delivery.
