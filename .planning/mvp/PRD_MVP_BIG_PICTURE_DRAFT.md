# PRD Draft: Orchestr8 Program To MVP (Big Picture)

Status: Draft for founder review
Owner: The Mayor (Codex)
Date: 2026-02-16

## 1. Product Thesis

Orchestr8 MVP is a deterministic visual software orchestration cockpit where:
- core controls are always reliable,
- Code City is the operational center,
- multi-agent execution flows through strict packet governance,
- founder oversight can happen without stalling engineering throughput.

## 2. MVP Problem Statement

Current pain is not lack of ideas; it is throughput collapse from coupling, unclear handoffs, and stop/start coordination overhead. MVP must solve:

1. Reliable operation of core shell + action flow.
2. Fast integration of value-add capabilities into Code City/runtime.
3. Continuous parallel lane execution with replay-based acceptance.
4. Founder-visible operational state and guidance loop.

## 3. MVP Outcome Definition

MVP is achieved when all conditions are true:

1. Canonical app lane runs stable marimo-first runtime and passes defined reliability + integration checks.
2. Core integration lane can ship packetized capabilities with deterministic replay pass criteria.
3. Extraction lane continuously provides clean-room, approved integration packets.
4. Founder console supports packet review/decision flow without terminal dependency.
5. Settlement lane continuously generates implementation-ready specs and acceptance matrices.

## 4. Guardrail Assumptions (Founder Comment Slots)

### A-01 Runtime Canon
Assumption: marimo-first runtime stays canonical through MVP.
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

### A-02 Identity
Assumption: `maestro` remains flagship-agent identity only.
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

### A-03 Lane Ownership
Assumption: visual placement authority remains canonical (`Orchestr8_jr`) only; other lanes expose contracts/streams.
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

### A-04 Governance Model
Assumption: no packet is complete without checkout + worklist + lint + closeout + canonical acceptance.
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

### A-05 Packaging Sequence
Assumption: packaging/compliance work starts only after core acceptance gate.
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

### A-06 Parallel Execution
Assumption: batch unlock model continues (all ready packets released together; approvals processed after completion callbacks).
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

### A-07 Artifact Contract
Assumption: all lane outputs must land in canonical artifacts path for review.
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

### A-08 Shared Memory Backbone
Assumption: current hardened shared-memory stack remains communication SOT.
Founder Comment:
- [ ] Agree
- [ ] Adjust:

## 5. MVP Scope By Capability

### 5.1 Core System Capability
- Deterministic action dispatch and state handling.
- Reliability harness + cutover/rollback discipline.
- Stable contract surface for shell/city/founder tooling.

### 5.2 Code City Capability
- 3D city rendering path preserved.
- 2D wiring/inspection paths integrated.
- Temporal state, automation, power, tour, and conversation capabilities integrated by packet.

### 5.3 Ops Governance Capability
- Packet lifecycle tooling and evidence gates enforceable.
- Multi-lane progress visible with low coordination latency.
- Rework/accept decisions are auditable and replayable.

### 5.4 Founder Operations Capability
- Packet queue + readiness view.
- Decision hooks with context.
- Annotation and timeline overlays.

### 5.5 Settlement Transfer Capability
- Topic synthesis -> master PRD -> transfer packets.
- Module acceptance matrices and test hooks for integration lanes.

## 6. Non-Goals (MVP)

1. No full packaging/distribution automation before core acceptance.
2. No direct code lift from extraction source repos.
3. No broad refactor of canonical visual style outside approved packet scope.
4. No expansion into unrelated product lines during MVP lock.

## 7. Acceptance Gates

### G-MVP-1 Core Reliability Gate
- Reliability and integration suites pass in canonical replay.
- No critical blockers in check-ins.

### G-MVP-2 Capability Convergence Gate
- B-lane capability packets pass with evidence.
- C-lane extraction packets accepted and consumed by B-lane.

### G-MVP-3 Founder Ops Gate
- Founder console supports end-to-end review/decision flow on live packet data.

### G-MVP-4 Settlement Traceability Gate
- Settlement outputs map to executable implementation hooks and acceptance matrix.

### G-MVP-5 Program Governance Gate
- Batch unlock cadence sustained without drift.
- All completion claims include canonical artifact proof and replay evidence.

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

1. Risk: Lane drift from prompt/boundary mismatch.
- Mitigation: hard-requirement lint gate per packet.

2. Risk: Throughput stalls due to parked lanes.
- Mitigation: pre-staged wave unlock sets and batch guidance release.

3. Risk: Integration quality regression.
- Mitigation: mandatory replay before acceptance decisions.

4. Risk: Cross-repo artifact ambiguity.
- Mitigation: canonical artifact delivery contract and closeout checks.

## 9. Initial Execution Plan

1. Freeze this PRD after founder comments.
2. Run per-codebase roadmaps and PRDs (this planning pack).
3. Generate Taskmaster task sets per codebase PRD.
4. Assign long-running packet execution windows per lane.
5. Conduct acceptance/rework cycles until all MVP gates pass.
