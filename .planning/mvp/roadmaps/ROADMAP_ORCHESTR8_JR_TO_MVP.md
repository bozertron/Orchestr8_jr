# MVP Roadmap: Orchestr8_jr (Canonical)

Owner: Canonical lane (`codex` / `antigravity`)
Mission: Governance truth + visual/runtime authority + acceptance gate execution.

## R0: Governance Baseline (Complete)
- Hard requirements, packet tooling, artifact contract, comms hardening in place.

## R1: Continuous Acceptance Loop (Active)
- Intake lane outputs.
- Replay tests.
- Accept/rework decisions with guidance updates.
- Zero-idle orchestration via batch unlock.

## R2: UI Canon Convergence
- Integrate validated capability streams into canonical UI surface map.
- Lock visual semantics: lower fifth, state rhythm, Code City presentation rules.
- Confirm marimo compatibility for each surface integration.

## R3: MVP Gate Assembly
- Run final regression, reliability, and convergence gates.
- Produce MVP gate memo and ship decision artifact.

## Exit Criteria
1. All active lane packets accepted or reworked to pass.
2. Canonical replay suite green for MVP set.
3. UI contract and runtime contract both stable.
