# MVP Roadmap: 2ndFid_explorers (Extraction)

Owner: `2ndFid_explorers`
Mission: clean-room extraction packets that accelerate Orchestr8/Code City features.

## R0: Extraction Protocol Baseline (Complete)
- Provenance + risk + licensing packet structure established.

## R1: High-Value Pattern Mining (Active)
- Produce extraction packet pairs per wave.
- Prioritize orchestration, observability, and operator UX patterns.

## R2: Integration Feedback Loop
- Refine extraction recommendations based on accepted/reworked outcomes.
- Improve target contract alignment with core lane needs.

## R3: MVP Extraction Coverage
- Ensure all MVP-critical capability gaps have extraction candidates.

## Exit Criteria
1. Required extraction packet sets accepted by canonical lane.
2. No licensing red flags unresolved.
3. Core lane has actionable clean-room plans for all MVP-critical gaps.
