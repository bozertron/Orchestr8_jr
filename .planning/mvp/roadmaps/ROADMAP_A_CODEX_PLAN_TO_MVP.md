# MVP Roadmap: a_codex_plan (Core Integration)

Owner: `a_codex_plan`
Mission: marimo-first core + capability integration with deterministic tests.

## R0: Core Foundation (Complete)

- Contracts, bridge, payload path, wiring path, parity checks delivered.

## R1: Capability Slice Integration (Active)

- Integrate approved extraction ideas into core services.
- Ship packetized modules with tests and smoke reports.
- Keep all artifacts canonical-ready.

## R2: Convergence With Settlement Specs

- Implement settlement-defined modules and test hooks.
- Align implementation to acceptance matrix.

## R3: Core-Complete Gate

- Pass all core integration, reliability, and parity checks.
- Freeze for canonical acceptance.

## R4: Packaging/Compliance (Deferred)

- Starts only after explicit core-complete approval.

## Exit Criteria

1. All required integration packets accepted by canonical lane.
2. Required test suites pass in lane and canonical replay.
3. No unresolved blocker in packet check-ins.
