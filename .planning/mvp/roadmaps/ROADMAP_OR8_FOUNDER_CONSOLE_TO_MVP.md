# MVP Roadmap: or8_founder_console

Owner: `or8_founder_console`
Mission: founder-grade command center for packet decision throughput.

## R0: Skeleton + Review APIs (Complete)
- Packet summary, flags, directives, review queue/readiness endpoints.

## R1: Decision Context Acceleration (Active)
- Annotation system and timeline endpoints integrated.
- Decision-linked context prepared.

## R2: Founder Workflow Completion
- Tight review->decision->guidance loop with minimal friction.
- Ensure all key packet states and artifacts are visible.

## R3: MVP Ops Hardening
- Add durability/audit polish needed for sustained packet cadence.

## Exit Criteria
1. Founder can process packet intake without terminal dependency.
2. Guidance actions are traceable and auditable.
3. Timeline and annotation data remain consistent under active load.
