# MVP Roadmap: mingos_settlement_lab

Owner: `mingos_settlement_lab`
Mission: synthesize strategy/spec corpus into executable transfer artifacts.

## R0: Corpus + Synthesis Foundation (Complete)
- Topic syntheses and PRD outline delivered.

## R1: Master Settlement Artifacts (Complete)
- Settlement master PRD and implementation backlog delivered.

## R2: Execution-Ready Transfer Layer (Active)
- Test hooks and acceptance matrix delivered.
- Tighten traceability from strategic concept -> implementation test.

## R3: Continuous Spec Support
- Feed new packets/spec deltas from active integration findings.

## Exit Criteria
1. All MVP module areas have traceable spec + test-hook coverage.
2. Transfer artifacts are consumed by core integration without ambiguity.
3. Canonical lane can gate decisions directly from settlement outputs.
