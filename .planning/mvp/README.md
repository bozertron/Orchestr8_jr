# MVP Planning Pack

This directory contains the cross-codebase planning package for the next run to MVP.

## Contents

- `PRD_MVP_BIG_PICTURE_DRAFT.md`: Program-level MVP draft with assumption/comment slots for founder review.
- `roadmaps/`: MVP roadmap per codebase/lane.
- `prds/`: Execution PRD per codebase/lane.
- `taskmaster/`: Taskmaster output files generated from each PRD.

## Active Codebases / Lanes

1. `Orchestr8_jr` (canonical governance + frontend integration authority)
2. `a_codex_plan` (core marimo-first integration)
3. `2ndFid_explorers` (clean-room extraction + conversion packets)
4. `or8_founder_console` (founder operations cockpit)
5. `mingos_settlement_lab` (settlement synthesis + transfer contracts)

## Planning Assumptions

- Packet governance remains mandatory (checkout -> worklist -> lint -> closeout -> acceptance).
- Canonical artifact delivery to `Orchestr8_jr` remains mandatory.
- No packaging lane starts before core acceptance gate.
