# PRD: mingos_settlement_lab To MVP

## 1. Objective

Convert strategic concept corpus into implementation-ready transfer artifacts that directly accelerate core integration and acceptance.

## 2. Problem

Strategic insights are abundant, but execution slows when requirements lack precise module hooks and acceptance mapping.

## 3. In Scope

- Topic synthesis and contradiction management.
- Master settlement PRD and backlog refinement.
- Transfer packets with module-level requirements.
- Test hooks and acceptance matrices.

## 4. Out of Scope

- Implementing runtime code in canonical/core lanes.
- Replacing packet governance process.

## 5. Functional Requirements

1. Maintain provenance from source topic to transfer requirement.
2. Define test hooks for each critical module area.
3. Define acceptance matrix mapping modules to pass/fail evidence.
4. Emit canonical reports for each packet.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

1. Documents must be implementation-oriented.
2. Traceability must be explicit and auditable.
3. Outputs must be consumable by integration lanes without extra interpretation.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

1. Transfer artifacts exist at required paths.
2. Traceability from module specs to test hooks is clear.
3. Canonical lane can directly apply outputs in packet boundaries.

## 8. Evidence Requirements

- Transfer docs and canonical report path.
- Traceability table.
- Shared memory completion ping.

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: strategic docs too broad for implementation.
- Mitigation: strict module-hook and acceptance-matrix structure.

- Risk: stale specs against active integration state.
- Mitigation: rolling packet updates tied to latest accepted outputs.
