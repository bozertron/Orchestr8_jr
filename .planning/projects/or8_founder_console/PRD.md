# PRD - Founder Console

## Problem
Founder/product decisions are delayed by fragmented status and artifact visibility.

## Outcome
One view to monitor and guide packet execution across lanes without stopping active work.

## MVP Features
1. Lane Queue: active packets with owner, ETA, gate color, blocker count.
2. Artifact Review: open markdown/artifacts and add inline comments with autosave.
3. Comms Panel: send OR8-COMMS messages with required metadata.
4. Unread Flags: show unread guidance/messages per agent.
5. Timeline: immutable event stream (checkout/progress/complete/accept/rework).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Founder can approve/rework packets without opening terminal.
- Any sent guidance is persisted and traceable with observation IDs.
- Packet status panel reflects canonical check-ins within 5 seconds.
