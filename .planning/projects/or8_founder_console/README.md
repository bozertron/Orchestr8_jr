# or8_founder_console (Blueprint)

Purpose:
- Founder-facing control surface for distributed agent execution.
- Reduce interruption cost by providing live queue visibility, artifact review, and inline feedback.

Scope:
- Live packet board (lane/phase/packet/status/ETA)
- Artifact viewer with inline autosave annotations
- Comms compose panel (guidance/question/blocker)
- Unread center (messages + guidance deltas)
- Media attachments linked to packets/artifacts

Non-goal:
- Replacing canonical execution governance in `Orchestr8_jr`.

SOT references:
- `README.AGENTS`
- `.planning/orchestr8_next/execution/HARD_REQUIREMENTS.md`
