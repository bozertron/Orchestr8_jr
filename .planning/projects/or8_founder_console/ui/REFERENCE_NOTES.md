# UI Reference Notes

Primary visual reference:
- `/home/bozertron/Downloads/orchestr8_ui_reference.html`

Rules:
- Preserve lower-fifth rhythm and typography direction.
- Surface density should optimize review velocity, not decorative UI.
- Distinguish canonical decisions from lane proposals clearly.
