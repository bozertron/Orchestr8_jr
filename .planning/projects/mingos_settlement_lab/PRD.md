# PRD - Mingos Settlement Lab

## Objective
Produce a hyper-detailed settlement PRD from a large document corpus, preserving provenance and transferability.

## Outputs
1. Corpus index by topic cluster
2. Topic synthesis docs (one per cluster)
3. Settlement master PRD
4. Transfer packets for `a_codex_plan`

## Acceptance
- Every conclusion links to source docs.
- Transfer packets are implementation-ready with contracts.
- Canonical lane can approve/rework each packet independently.
