# Orchestr8 Stylize + Landscape Execution PRD

Date: 2026-02-13  
Status: Draft (decision-gated)  
Owner: Founder + implementation agent

## 1. Objective

Ship a styling-first execution wave for Orchestr8 that:

1. Locks visual quality and compatibility before adding new wiring.
2. Makes Code City feel distinct, futuristic, and navigable at scale.
3. Establishes a reliable path to advanced interaction concepts (gesture + particle presence).
4. Preserves canonical runtime path and existing stability work.

## 2. Locked Execution Order

1. Visual contract pass:
   - colors, typography, spacing, emergence behavior.
2. Browser compatibility pass:
   - CSS syntax validity, unsupported features, 3D/runtime compatibility checks.
3. Responsive pass:
   - desktop and mobile-safe layout behavior.
4. Wiring pass:
   - component/button/event hookups.
5. Test-drive pass:
   - full end-to-end UX/stability validation.

## 3. Canonical Constraints

1. Entry/runtime:
   - `orchestr8.py -> IP/plugins/06_maestro.py -> IP/woven_maps.py`
2. Color system:
   - working `#D4AF37`
   - broken `#1fbdea`
   - combat `#9D4EDD`
3. Motion:
   - emergence-only, no breathing/pulsing.
4. Top row canon:
   - `[orchestr8] [collabor8] [JFDI]`
5. Interaction rule:
   - marimo button callbacks use `on_click`.

## 4. Product Direction (Founder Inputs to Preserve)

1. Art direction:
   - Art-deco flare in visual language.
   - Low-res, high-style overlays where intentional.
2. Documentation experience:
   - Replace bland “wall-poster” docs with “arcade + zine” style delivery surfaces.
   - “City Hall” remains structured info anchor; “Arcade” becomes full-experience guidance layer.
3. Interaction concepts:
   - Low-expectation gesture interface (within reason) for high-level navigation and simple media control.
   - Particle presence system: stylized likeness/persona rendered using canonical system colors.
4. Near-future hardware prep:
   - Architectural readiness for mmWave radar based “particle cam” integration.
5. Signature moments:
   - Overview-to-dive Code City camera experience as marquee differentiator.
   - Playable arcade layer to separate tools by place and function.

## 5. Scope by Wave

### Wave A: Look + Compatibility Hardening (No New Wiring)

Deliverables:

1. Color and typography normalization across active UI surfaces.
2. CSS/browser compatibility audit with source-level fixes.
3. 3D frontend compatibility checklist for `IP/static/woven_maps_3d.js`.
4. Responsive layout pass for top row, VOID center, bottom control surface, right-side panels.

Acceptance:

1. No parser-breaking CSS warnings from project-owned styles.
2. Canon colors consistently visible across key panels and controls.
3. Layout remains functional across desktop and narrow viewport.
4. Existing controls do not regress.

### Wave B: Landscape + Signature Experience Layer

Deliverables:

1. Code City stylization pass:
   - district identity, atmosphere, and navigation readability.
2. Arcade/Zine information architecture proposal and first in-app surface.
3. Camera choreography baseline:
   - overview default
   - dive transition skeleton
4. Particle presence concept stub (non-critical prototype quality acceptable).

Acceptance:

1. Distinct visual identity beyond baseline utility UI.
2. At least one high-quality “wow factor” transition validated.
3. Information surfaces feel intentional and discoverable by place.

### Wave C: Wiring + Test Drive

Deliverables:

1. One-by-one wiring of remaining dead controls.
2. Panel behavior validation and bridge hardening.
3. End-to-end test drive with defined scenarios.

Acceptance:

1. Button/control behavior matches spec for wired surfaces.
2. No reload/placeholder hacks in critical path controls.
3. Runtime remains stable under normal operator flow.

## 6. Outstanding Backlog to Carry Forward (From `SOT/todo.md`)

Priority carry-ins:

1. Camera + navigation contract:
   - overview lock, warp-dive, round-trip context, keyframes.
2. Error signal behavior:
   - broken-node pollution particles, interaction contract.
3. Boundaries/contracts:
   - neighborhood overlays, crossing badges, lock indicators.
4. Ingestion semantics:
   - settlement survey adapter, status precedence lock.
5. Effects math:
   - short-edge layering, curl noise, wave interference, phase machine.
6. Audio mapping:
   - deterministic band mapping + optional BPM clock.
7. Interaction surface:
   - neighborhood detail card, directional panel emergence, action strip.
8. Broken-node flow:
   - structured ticket payload generation + lock-aware deploy handoff.

## 7. Critical Decisions Needed

1. Particle control strategy:
   - quickest path to real-time tunability for “wow factor” exploration.
2. Art-deco system:
   - how far to push stylization in primary flow vs themed surfaces.
3. Gesture scope:
   - minimum viable gesture set for reliability.
4. Particle presence fidelity:
   - symbolic persona vs pseudo-avatar motion complexity.
5. Arcade architecture:
   - in-VOID native layer vs routed feature districts.
6. Hardware-prep boundary:
   - interfaces to lock now for mmWave particle-cam future.

## 8. Non-Goals (for this PRD wave)

1. Full mmWave integration implementation.
2. Exhaustive mobile-first redesign of all legacy plugin screens.
3. Massive new feature wiring before compatibility and visual contract are complete.

## 9. Exit Criteria

1. Visual and compatibility baseline is production-safe.
2. Signature Code City experience direction is validated with at least one compelling interaction.
3. Wiring starts only after look/compatibility/responsiveness are accepted.
4. Final integrated test-drive produces a clear go/no-go report for next wave.
