## Why This Is Painful

- General integration risk: enforce tests around schema, state, and behavior contracts.

## Anchor Lines

- `.planning/codebase/prompts/TERMINAL-6-REMAINING.md:25` 13. `IP/styles/orchestr8.css` — FULL CSS AUDIT. Every class, every color value, any .stereos-* remnants

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
