## Why This Is Painful

- General integration risk: enforce tests around schema, state, and behavior contracts.

## Anchor Lines

- `.planning/STATE.md:30` - **v1.0**: Brand replaced stereOS → orchestr8 (Phase 1 complete)

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
