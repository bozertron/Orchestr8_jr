## Why This Is Painful

- Constraint-heavy document: treat as canonical rules, not optional guidance.
- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `.planning/phases/ARCHITECT-BARRADEAU.md:100` ### Color Alignment (LOCKED)
- `.planning/phases/ARCHITECT-BARRADEAU.md:110` ### Building Formula (LOCKED - already correct)
- `.planning/phases/ARCHITECT-BARRADEAU.md:227` ### Emergence Pattern (LOCKED - no breathing)
- `.planning/phases/ARCHITECT-BARRADEAU.md:244` - [ ] Emergence animation (no breathing)

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
