- SHA256: `b9a70561529bc0287c20444fdc133925a7519a01acd88bf834b3aaec1284a3c3`
- Role: Active implementation tracker for Code City/WebGPU work

## Why This Is Painful

- Canon and implementation are tightly coupled; stale checklist state creates execution drift.
- This file is used as sprint truth for handoffs across compacted contexts.

## Anchor Lines

- `SOT/todo.md:140` role+history patchbay pass timestamp
- `SOT/todo.md:153` role-aware apply gate completion
- `SOT/todo.md:154` per-connection action history completion

## Integration Use

- Keep timestamps + checkboxes updated in the same commit window.
- Treat this file as sequencing authority for next Code City steps.
