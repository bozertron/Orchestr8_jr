## Why This Is Painful

- General integration risk: enforce tests around schema, state, and behavior contracts.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/888/actu8/tests/test_adapter.py:180` # Test saving without file path (should fail)

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
