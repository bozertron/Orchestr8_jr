## Why This Is Painful

- Constraint-heavy document: treat as canonical rules, not optional guidance.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/888/panel_foundation/base_panel.py:26` This provides the common interface that all panels must implement,
- `one integration at a time/888/panel_foundation/base_panel.py:27` ensuring consistency across orchestr8, integr8, communic8, actu8, cre8, innov8.

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
