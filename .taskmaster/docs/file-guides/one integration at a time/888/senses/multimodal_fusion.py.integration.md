- Memory chunks: `5`
- Observation IDs: `328..332`

## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/888/senses/multimodal_fusion.py:98` target_panel="orchestr8",
- `one integration at a time/888/senses/multimodal_fusion.py:121` target_panel="orchestr8",
- `one integration at a time/888/senses/multimodal_fusion.py:272` # Example: boost library navigation if user is currently in orchestr8

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
