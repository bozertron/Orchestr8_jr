## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/888/director/workflow_optimizer.py:138` if step.get('zone') == 'orchestr8':  # AI assistant - variable time

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
