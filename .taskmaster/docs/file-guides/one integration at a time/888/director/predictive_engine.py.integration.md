## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/888/director/predictive_engine.py:268` all_zones = ['orchestr8', 'integr8', 'communic8', 'actu8', 'cre8', 'innov8']

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
