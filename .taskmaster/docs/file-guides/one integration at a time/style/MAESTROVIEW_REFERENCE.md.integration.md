## Why This Is Painful

- Constraint-heavy document: treat as canonical rules, not optional guidance.
- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
