## Why This Is Painful

- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/Big Pickle/REFERENCES.md:220` Gold (#D4AF37)   - Working code, completion state
- `one integration at a time/Big Pickle/REFERENCES.md:222` Purple (#9D4EDD) - Combat state (LLM deployed)
- `one integration at a time/Big Pickle/REFERENCES.md:235` - ✅ Teal → Gold transitions
- `one integration at a time/Big Pickle/REFERENCES.md:258` 2. **Teal during scan, Gold on completion** - Phase-based color

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
