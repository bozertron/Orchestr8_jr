## Why This Is Painful

- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/docs/code_city_feedback.md:31` Archive/app_orchestr8.py
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/docs/code_city_feedback.md:44` | File Path | `Archive/app_orchestr8.py` |
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/docs/code_city_feedback.md:79` **Recommended Fix**: The detection should use regex to match comment-style TODOs:
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/docs/code_city_feedback.md:105` | Purple sphere | Currently selected file |
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/docs/code_city_feedback.md:126` 1. The selected file `Archive/app_orchestr8.py` is marked as `BROKEN` - **BUT this is an ARCHIVED file** (the active version is `orchestr8_standalone.py`)
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/docs/code_city_feedback.md:147` Archive/app_orchestr8.py

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
