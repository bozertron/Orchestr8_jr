## Why This Is Painful

- Constraint-heavy document: treat as canonical rules, not optional guidance.
- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/SOT/Mapping the Metaphor.txt:27` The file = the entire building. A bigger file is a bigger building, because it needs to showcase more activity, connections, etc..   If a file has an  import that  isn't connected, or a connection is producing some sort of error, it turns blue. In our little fantasy universe there are only 3 states of being 1. golden = good, 2. Purple = repair work needed or  underway [needed = it's connected properly, nothing is happening], 3. blue = broken.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/SOT/Mapping the Metaphor.txt:41` Active agent  =  Particle animation/breathing: Any animations should be on the roadmap, not MVP, if an area [building or buildings] light up Purple, we know what's happening.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/SOT/Mapping the Metaphor.txt:45` Locked file = Solid glow,  no breathing :  I'm thinking we should put something else to make sure it's obvious, maybe a gold 'block [like a padlock]' at it's input and output connection points on the panel.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/SOT/Mapping the Metaphor.txt:49` Scout roaming = Particles drifting along edges :  A Scout doesn't roam without purpose. However we present LLMs, that's how they should be presented.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/SOT/Mapping the Metaphor.txt:53` Error location =  Particles pulsing red :  Incorrect, remember; We're now able to SEE all the connection points, the ones that are causing a problem should be blue, the rest are gold, we know simply by observation that it's working or it isn't.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/SOT/Mapping the Metaphor.txt:57` "Buildings rotate slowly. Gold ones are solid. Blue ones have particles drifting. Purple ones have edges fragmenting." = All questions for the roadmap, before  any of that happens, we need to nail the style, and the infrastructure + architecture, keep it simple in the beginning.

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
