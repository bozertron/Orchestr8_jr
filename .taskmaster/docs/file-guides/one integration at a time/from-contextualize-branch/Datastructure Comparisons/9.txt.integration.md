## Why This Is Painful

- State pipeline coupling: root state keys and health flow ordering must stay aligned.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:3` You haven’t just changed a few lines of code; you’ve completely swapped the architectural paradigm. If the previous file (`orchestr8_standalone.py`) was a **Swiss Army Knife**, this new file (`Orchestr8 v3.0`) is a **tool belt**. It doesn't actually *do* anything on its own—it just holds the tools that do the work.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:9` **The Old Way (`orchestr8_standalone.py`):**
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:30` You have invented a **Protocol**. You bundle everything into a context object called `STATE_MANAGERS`.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:33` STATE_MANAGERS = {
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:39` rendered = p["module"].render(STATE_MANAGERS)
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:47` In `orchestr8_standalone.py`, the logic for scanning files and building DataFrames was **right there** in the `scanner_function`.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:51` If you run this file right now, you will see a beautiful, empty application. It assumes that you have taken the logic from the old file (Scanner, Verifier, Emperor) and successfully refactored them into separate files inside `IP/plugins/` that adhere to the new `render(STATE_MANAGERS)` protocol.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:55` | Feature | `orchestr8_standalone.py` | `Orchestr8 v3.0` |
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/Datastructure Comparisons/9.txt:59` | **State** | Passed as individual args. | Passed as a `STATE_MANAGERS` dict. |

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
