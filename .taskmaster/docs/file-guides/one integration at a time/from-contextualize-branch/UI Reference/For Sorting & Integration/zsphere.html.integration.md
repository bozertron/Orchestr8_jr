## Why This Is Painful

- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/zsphere.html:100` // Inner core is White (Wisdom), Outer is Gold
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/zsphere.html:102` vec3 shellColor = vec3(0.83, 0.68, 0.21); // Gold

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
