## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.
- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/v3.html:14` 3.  **OR**, paste it directly into the Z.ai chat window. (It should now work, though performance might be lower than a native file).
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/v3.html:120` <button id="btn-fix-bug">Restore (Gold)</button>
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/v3.html:190` // STATE LOGIC (Gold vs Blue)
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/v3.html:202` // Gold State

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
