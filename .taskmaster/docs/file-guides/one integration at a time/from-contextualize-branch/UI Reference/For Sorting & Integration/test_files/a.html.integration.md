## Why This Is Painful

- Constraint-heavy document: treat as canonical rules, not optional guidance.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/test_files/a.html:190` "Please check your address bar. It must start with <strong>file://</strong>";

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
