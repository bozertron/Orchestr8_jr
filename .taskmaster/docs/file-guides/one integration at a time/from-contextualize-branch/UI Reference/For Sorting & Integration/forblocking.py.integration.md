## Why This Is Painful

- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.
- Behavioral sequencing risk: mode transitions need explicit state machine handling.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/forblocking.py:9` Since you have access to a file system (/home/bozertron/), we can use Python to render the "Code City" directly in your command line. It will use ASCII art to visualize the Fiefdoms, Gold/Blue states, and Thresholds—proving the logic works without needing a web browser.
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/forblocking.py:57` def render_ascii(self, view_offset, cam_zoom):
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/forblocking.py:67` # Logic: Is this point inner (Wisdom) or outer (Gold)?
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/forblocking.py:84` char_color = C_GOLD # Gold Standard
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/forblocking.py:139` print(f"\n  {C_WHITE}█{C_RESET} = Structure / Gold")

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
