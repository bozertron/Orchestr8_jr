## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.
- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/v4.html:103` <button id="btn-fix-bug">Restore (Gold)</button>
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/v4.html:142` let globalState = 0; // 0 = Gold, 1 = Blue
- `one integration at a time/from-contextualize-branch/UI Reference/For Sorting & Integration/v4.html:215` state: 0 // 0=Gold, 1=Blue

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
