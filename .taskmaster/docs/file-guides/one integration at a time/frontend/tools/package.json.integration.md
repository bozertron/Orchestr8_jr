## Why This Is Painful

- General integration risk: enforce tests around schema, state, and behavior contracts.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/frontend/tools/package.json:2` "name": "orchestr8-scaffold-cli",
- `one integration at a time/frontend/tools/package.json:13` "orchestr8",

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
