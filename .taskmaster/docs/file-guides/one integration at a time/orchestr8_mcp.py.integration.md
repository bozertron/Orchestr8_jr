## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/orchestr8_mcp.py:14` python orchestr8_mcp.py
- `one integration at a time/orchestr8_mcp.py:17` uvx fastmcp run orchestr8_mcp.py

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
