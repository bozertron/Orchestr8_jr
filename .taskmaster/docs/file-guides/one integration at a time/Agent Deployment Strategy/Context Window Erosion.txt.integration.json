Critical Development Note: Use 'all the tools in the toolbox' = We've got a bunch of very advanced calculators in this application; can you use them? Some of them? All of them? How will this particular load, affect other loads? = that should be accounted for. Go deep here, it'll pay off in spades when we're integrating other load calculators... in fact... my suggestion is that you parse all the tools to determine ALL the loads we need to calculate and figure out a crisp piece of code that can be manipulated to provide very sophisticated physics modelling that yields unprecedented big picture outputs and triggers warnings in other modules that get surfaced to the main UI page. I'm very much looking forward to reviewing your plan on this one."

Also, please consider how this one wrapped up, and how we can use this - if viewed as a development strategy - to drive our ongoing efforts. For example, you now know that if you hit a stub, or an import that could simply 'be removed', your human team will not be a fan of that decision. Based on our leanings, should we create another Agent = 'The EPO Human Advocacy Agent'. My initial suggestion is that this agent considers the 'EPO human element' and performs an analysis on any/all failures, and considers what 'the user of the [tool name]' would want to perform their job to yield a delightful outcome, while experiencing a delightful UI and system experience.
