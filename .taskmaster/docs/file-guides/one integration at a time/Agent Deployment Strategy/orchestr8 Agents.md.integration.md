## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/Agent Deployment Strategy/orchestr8 Agents.md:1` ## orchestr8's Foundational Principles - Agent Deployment Architecture
- `one integration at a time/Agent Deployment Strategy/orchestr8 Agents.md:402` │     • IMPLEMENT: Feature should be built, not removed           │
- `one integration at a time/Agent Deployment Strategy/orchestr8 Agents.md:450` 1. **Stage Files** - Determine which files should be in commit
- `one integration at a time/Agent Deployment Strategy/orchestr8 Agents.md:515` - If code is referenced, it should exist
- `one integration at a time/Agent Deployment Strategy/orchestr8 Agents.md:525` - Every feature should work completely

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
