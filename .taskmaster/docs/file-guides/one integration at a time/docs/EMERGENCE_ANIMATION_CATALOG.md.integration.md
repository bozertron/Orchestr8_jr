## Why This Is Painful

- Large surface area: high chance of hidden coupling and missed assumptions.
- Behavioral sequencing risk: mode transitions need explicit state machine handling.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/docs/EMERGENCE_ANIMATION_CATALOG.md:593` tools="pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset"
- `one integration at a time/docs/EMERGENCE_ANIMATION_CATALOG.md:1534` - Flow visualization for data pipelines

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
