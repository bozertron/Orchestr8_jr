## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/star-vector/starvector/validation/svg_validator_base.py:31` # Flag to determine if we should report to wandb

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
