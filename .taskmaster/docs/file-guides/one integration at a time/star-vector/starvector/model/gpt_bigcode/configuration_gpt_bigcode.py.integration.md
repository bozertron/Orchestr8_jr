## Why This Is Painful

- General integration risk: enforce tests around schema, state, and behavior contracts.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/star-vector/starvector/model/gpt_bigcode/configuration_gpt_bigcode.py:68` Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models).

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
