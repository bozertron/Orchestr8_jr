# MVP_5th_Resourcing_GeneratorBallet.md Integration Guide

- Source: `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/MVP_5th_Resourcing_GeneratorBallet.md`
- Total lines: `305`
- SHA256: `0baa18b13bae5b0f4d5304e7c04ada79ad33eadb79281229a619aa97fe6e0aea`
- Memory chunks: `3`
- Observation IDs: `773..775`

## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.
- Constraint-heavy document: treat as canonical rules, not optional guidance.
- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
