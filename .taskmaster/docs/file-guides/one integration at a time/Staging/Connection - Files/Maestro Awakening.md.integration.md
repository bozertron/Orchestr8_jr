## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.
- Visual canon risk: color/motion contract regressions are easy to introduce.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/Maestro Awakening.md:310` // Teal color
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/Maestro Awakening.md:343` // Teal
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/Maestro Awakening.md:429` // Teal
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/Maestro Awakening.md:472` // Gold phase: settled into alchemical form
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/Maestro Awakening.md:517` // Gold (stable)

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
