## Why This Is Painful

- Medium-large surface area: requires strict scope control during integration.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/backendDetails.md:123` * **Out:** Defines the message contracts for WebSocket communication.

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
