## Why This Is Painful

- Behavioral sequencing risk: mode transitions need explicit state machine handling.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/i8.md:7` - **Phase 1**: Database schema extensions and backend API commands
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/i8.md:14` The next phase should focus on deeper integration with existing components and adding advanced functionality.
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/i8.md:30` - ConnectionVerifier should pass verification results to the Integr8 system
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/i8.md:31` - The verification logic should understand feature boundaries and dependencies
- `one integration at a time/Staging/Connection - Files/i8.md:50` - Enable zooming and filtering to focus on specific parts of the feature graph

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
