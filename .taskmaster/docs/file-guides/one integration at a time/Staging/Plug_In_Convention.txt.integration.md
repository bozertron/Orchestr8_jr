## Why This Is Painful

- Constraint-heavy document: treat as canonical rules, not optional guidance.

## Anchor Lines

- `one integration at a time/Staging/Plug_In_Convention.txt:18` commandType: string; // The unique identifier (e.g., 'overview', 'stores'). MUST match file name convention if possible.

## Integration Use

- Read this first to avoid re-deriving constraints.
- Implement against these anchors, then verify in runtime tests.
